### Dan A. O'Brien

I am an experienced writer, editor, and teacher, with a passion for education and technology. I have written and edited several non-fiction books, and my work has also appeared in the Irish Times, the Dublin Review of Books, and on RTÃ‰. I am a life long learner, and am currently completing a Higher Diploma in Computer Science. I work in technical writing and information development, where my love of writing and the the wired world can flourish.
